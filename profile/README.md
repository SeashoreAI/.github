This is where publicly available material from our community is uploaded    
## Our Goals  
We have 3 main goals:   
1. Create a global community for AI
2. Get scientists from outher fields in AI and show them how they can combine theri research with AI
3. Help make the process of learning AI and ML easier
We strongly believe that AI and ML do not have any usage if used alone
Thats why we want to focus on the usage of AI in combination with other sciences
