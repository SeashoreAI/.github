# SeashoreAI   
Welcome to the official github page of SeashoreAI    
This is where publicly available material from our community is uploaded    
## Our Goals  
We have 3 main goals:   
1. Create a global community for AI
2. Get scientists from outher fields in AI and show them how they can combine theri research with AI
3. Help make the process of learning AI and ML easier
We strongly believe that AI and ML do not have any usage if used alone       
Thats why we want to focus on the usage of AI in combination with other sciences  
Such examples are Finance,Healt,Environmental Sciences
## Our Projects   
### Prediction of the Forex Market
The first project that we are currently working on has to do with Foreing Exchanges                  
We want to create an AI that can make accurate multi-factor forex prediction                        
Using multiple inputs (geopolitical,long-term and short term economical factors)      
This have been categorised as impossible but with your help we could maybe    
Try to create the next "money-making" machine
