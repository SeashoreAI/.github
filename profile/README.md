# SeashoreAI   
Welcome to the official github page of SeashoreAI    
This is where publicly available material from our community is uploaded    
## Our Goals  
We have 3 main goals:   
1. Create a global community for AI
2. Get scientists from outher fields in AI and show them how they can combine theri research with AI
3. Help make the process of learning AI and ML easier
We strongly believe that AI and ML do not have any usage if used alone       
Thats why we want to focus on the usage of AI in combination with other sciences  
Such examples are Finance,Healt,Environmental Sciences
## Our Projects   
### Creation of a Discord Community     
We want to create a place to talk about AI      
After some research we figured out that the best place to do so would be discord
With the help of experienced discord users, we plan on creating a community there
### Prediction of the Forex Market
The first project that we are currently working on has to do with Foreing Exchanges                  
We want to create an AI that can make accurate multi-factor forex prediction                        
Using multiple inputs such as:
1. Geopolitical economical factors       
2. Long-term economical factors     
3. Short term economical factors      
4. Stock Market
5. Price of Gold
This have been categorised as impossible but with your help we could maybe    
Try to create the next "money-making" machine
